# This code is simple, it takes in a data frame which has the stats of the hitting lineup in order
# and the number of the last hitter. It then runs the at-bat simulator in order through the hitting lineup
# until 3 outs are registered. Since we are modelling a game as a Markov chain it only needs to know
# the last situation to work out what happens. This keeps an innings log by binding the results
# of each plate appearance to each other in an dataframe. Each row is one PA.
